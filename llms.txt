# Omnipotent

> Omnipotent is a Federated AI Sovereign Operating System — a self-healing,
> multi-agent orchestration platform that runs entirely on user-owned
> infrastructure with Docker Swarm, Deno, and Rust.

Omnipotent coordinates AI agent swarms through two closed-loop orchestration
protocols with mandatory human checkpoints, a Signal Bus architecture, and
tiered memory (Hot/Cold/Federated).

## Core Architecture

- **Kernel (Archon):** A Deno runtime for background agents with Signal Bus coordination.
- **Orchestration (Two Loops):** Planning Loop + Execution Loop with mandatory human checkpoints. Perceive, plan, execute, reflect.
- **Memory (Mnemosyne):** Hot (filesystem), Cold (pgvector), Federated (Graphiti temporal knowledge graphs).

## The Legion — 12 Agent Personas

Archon (Kernel Architect), Oracle (Intel & Research), Shadow Route (Ops & Orchestration), Validitus (Security & QA), Codex (Ancient Wise / Truth), Eidolon (UI/Voice Creative), Artificer (CI/CD & Self-Upgrade), Diplomat (Federation Sync), Quartermaster (Supply & Scaffold), Scout (Reconnaissance), Mnemon (Memory Keeper), Mercator (Cartographer).

## Key Protocols

- **Signal Bus:** Event-driven inter-agent communication (omnipotent:bus:*).
- **Mnemosyne Protocol:** Tiered memory system preventing context drift and hallucination.
- **Ouroboros Protocol:** Self-healing, self-updating infrastructure via Blue/Green container swap.
- **Airlock Protocol:** Controlled federation sync between Sovereign (local) and Alliance (remote) data.
- **Mirror of Void:** Recursive self-correction cycle (Autopsy, Calculus, Evolution).

## Tech Stack

Docker Swarm, Deno, Rust, Redis, PostgreSQL (pgvector), Graphiti, LangGraph.
